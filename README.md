# second-hand-website

/!\ Work in progress /!\

I'm currently building a second-hand website specialized in handy-work where users could:

-  Post Ads whether to ask/offer for an handy-work object or service -- for free -- (give an old tool that you don't user, ask for someone to help you fix you shelves...)

## Technologies used:

-  NextJs / React
-  AdonisJs
-  Formik
-  Yup
-  Axios

## Goal of this project

-  Learn NextJs
-  Understand and build the connection between front-end and back-end
