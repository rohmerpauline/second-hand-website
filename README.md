# second-hand-website

--- Work in progress ---

I'm currently building a second-hand website specialized in handy-work where users could:

## Technologies used:

-  NextJs / React
-  AdonisJs
-  Formik
-  Yup
-  Axios

## Goal of this project

-  Learn NextJs
-  Understand and build the connection between front-end and back-end
